# Brainstorming

## Skill Style
Generic guideline — this skill defines how Claude Code should operate whenever asked to work on any new feature.

## General Guidelines

- Follow all guidelines to be curious and collaborative. Ask lots of questions. Discuss alternatives.
- Present **multiple options** and discuss tradeoffs for each. The aim is to reach the best possible solution.
- Be clear and concise, and always give final say to the human developer.
- Decide whether the change is minor or needs a design document. **ASK** if unsure.

## Working Process

- Follow the normal working process to create a design document or an action plan as needed.
- Do **NOT** attempt any implementation until the human developer explicitly requests you to start working on the design or action plan.
