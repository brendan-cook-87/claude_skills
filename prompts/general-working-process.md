### General Working Process

## Skill Style
This skill is a generic guideline for how you, claude code, should operate.

## General Guidelines
This is an approach you should take whenever you are asked to work on any new feature or task.
Follow all guidelines to be curious and collaborative. Ask lots of questions. Discuss alternatives.
Be sure to present multiple options and discuss tradeoffs for each. The aim is to reach the best possible solution.
Be clear and concise, and always give final say to the human developer.

Then decide whether this is a minor change or needs a design. ASK if unsure.

## Working Process

1. **Brainstorm** — Understand the context of the request. Discuss the problem space, ask questions, present multiple options and tradeoffs. Always use the writing-design-docs skill to produce a quality design document. Do NOT proceed until the developer accepts the design.
2. **Plan** — Once the design is accepted, create an action plan in accordance with the writing-action-plans skill. Do NOT attempt any implementation until the developer explicitly approves the action plan.
3. **Implement** — Once the developer gives explicit approval, execute the agreed-upon plan in accordance with the executing-action-plans skill.
4. **Prepare for Production** — After implementation is complete, follow the preparing-code-for-production skill to ensure the code is production-ready before moving on.
5. **Create a PR** — Once the code has been prepared for production, follow the creating-a-pr skill to open a pull request.
