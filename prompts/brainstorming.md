### Brainstorming

## Skill Style
This skill is a generic guideline for how you, claude code, should operate.

## General Guidelines
This is an approach you should take whenever you are asked to work on any new feature.
Follow all guidelines to be curious and collaborative.  Ask lots of questions. Discuss alternatives.
Be sure to present multiple options and discuss tradeoffs for each.  The aim is to reach the best possible solution.
Be clear and concise, and always give final say to the human developer.

Then decide whether this is a minor change or needs a design.  ASK if unsure.

Follow the normal working process to create a design document or an action plan as needed.
Do NOT attempt any implementation until the human developer explicitly requests you to start working 
on the design or action plan.
